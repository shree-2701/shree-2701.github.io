    <P> Cooperative learning is based on group work, but it’s also so much more than that.

        The core element of cooperative learning is to showcase the positive effects of interdependence while underlining the importance of personal responsibility.
        
        This happens naturally in cooperative learning since students work with one another, but they all have a different task to accomplish or concept to explain.
        
        As a bonus, your students are being social while they’re working in cooperative learning. That could be an advantage or disadvantage for you, depending on the class.
        
        Regardless, the experience of working socially can help students with soft skills, which is a nice bonus to cooperative learning in general.

        <P> True cooperative learning involves more than just having students sit together in groups. When done well, cooperative learning involves planning with clear directions, student work roles, and outcomes and measures for learning goals. Teachers who use this method see the value in cooperation, teamwork, and collaboration as a major part of their classrooms. Students who learn how to collaborate through cooperative learning can become adults who work together more effectively in the work place.
